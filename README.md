# LG Inform Plus API

## What is it?
The API allows anyone to view and download open data about local areas, such as demographic details and performance data. It's been built to support both amateur and professional developers, and can help you deliver information services that matter. It's free for the first 500 MB but [developers can subscribe](http://help.esd.org.uk/support/solutions/articles/5000629000) to extend their limit, and the limit for [subscribing local authorities](http://help.esd.org.uk/support/solutions/articles/5000010045) is larger. 

## What can I use the API for?
* Enrich apps with data about local places and people.
* Create a community dashboard for your local council.
* Target segmented customers based on government-sourced data.
* Power GIS tools with neighbourhoods and meaningful geographies.
* And much more!

## Who has used it?
A wide variety of groups, from a group of individuals looking at [lifestyle-based living in London](http://bit.ly/cloudOver) to the Local Government Association, where it's used to power their nationwide local govenment performance information service, [LG Inform](http://lginform.local.gov.uk/).
